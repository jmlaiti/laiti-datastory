				<h2> Data Collection </h2>
				<p2> This generation of the millennial hardly ever watches live TV anymore, and even less watch the news. Even though I'm interested in what's going on and keeping up with current events, it's not the culture to sit down and watch the news anymore; hardly any college students I know even have cable. I've found that push notifications for news websites are the best way for me to keep updated. And even with these abrupt notifications on my phone, I don't always click on it. With this being my primary source of keeping updated, I wanted to track how much I actually do interact with the headlines. Over the course of a week I tracked how many push notifications I recieved from my 4 News apps: CNN, Fox, Washington Post, and Wall Street Journal.<p2>
				<h2> Data Visulization <h2>
			</section>
			<section id="social">
				<div>I created an instance chart that allowed me to emphasize the most important aspect, news topics, over the course of a week. I was interested to see how many notifications I received in different sectors of the news and which I opened the most, as indicated by circling the instances. The instance chart allowed me to organize it by topics while also showing the time, which is interesting as you see throughout the week when different events in the news were. I also utilized color to show the various news apps I received push notifications from (CNN, FOX, WSJ, Washington Post). </div>

     			 <h2> <b> Explained Video </b> </h2>
     			 
					 <p1> Because most people nowadays gather their news online, it’s important to understand how the news is presented to you. There is a new phenomenon called Psychographics and it is a technique that has been used by marketing companies to understand the unique perspectives, desires, wants and needs of the general population. This strategy used by product companies, but also news outlets- this video explains how.  <p1>
