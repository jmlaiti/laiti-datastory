				<h2> Data Collection </h2>
				<p2> This generation of millennial hardly ever watches live TV anymore, or even less watch the news. Even though I'm interested in what's going on and keeping up with current events - it's not the culture to sit down and watch the news anymore; hardly any college students I know even have cable. I've found that push notifications for news websites are the best way for me to keep updated. And even with these abrupt notifications on my phone, I don't always click on it. With this being my primary source of keeping updated, I wanted to track how much I actually do interact with the headlines. Over the course of a week I tracked how many push notifications I recieved from my 4 News apps: CNN, Fox, Washington Post, and Wall Street Journal.<p2>

					 <p> My observations from my data collection and visualization offered a better insight into how Spotify took the music streaming market 
           			 into its own hands. The algorithms and constant customers subscriptions keeps Spotify in the lead.
